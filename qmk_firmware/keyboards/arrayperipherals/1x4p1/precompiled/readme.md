# Personal Hex Files for [1x4] + 1 Macropad 

* Default: Default Layout with 2 Layers
* Default w/ Via: Default Layout with 2 Layers and via enabled.
* Osu: This is used for OSU and the rotary is set to scrolling as it's useful for scrolling through songs.
* Osu w/ Inverted Scrolling: This is used for OSU and the rotary is set to inverted scrolling as it's useful for scrolling through songs. 
* Via w/ Media: This is used mainly for media as it has rotary set to adjust the volume. It's only used if I'm listening to music only.
* Via w/ Inverted Scrolling: This is used to have via enabled and having the rotary set to inverted scrolling. I personally use this when reading manga,manhua,webtoons as it's easier to scroll with a knob than mouse wheel.
