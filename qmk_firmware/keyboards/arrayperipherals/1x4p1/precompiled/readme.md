# [1x4] + 1 Macropad Personal Hex Files

* Default: Default Layout with 4 Layers
* Default w/ Via: Default Layout with 4 Layers and via enabled.
* Osu: This is used for OSU and the rotary is set to scrolling as it's useful for scrolling through songs. Turning Left = Down | Turning Right = Up
* Osu w/ Inverted Scrolling: This is used for OSU and the rotary is set to scrolling as it's useful for scrolling through songs. Turning Left = Up | Turning Right = Down
* Via w/ Media: This is used mainly for media as it has rotary set to adjust the volume. It's only used if I'm listening to music only.
* Via w/ Inverted Scrolling: This is used to have via enabled and having the rotary set to Inverted Scrolling. I personally use this when reading manga,manhua,webtoons as it's easier to scroll with a knob than mouse wheel.
