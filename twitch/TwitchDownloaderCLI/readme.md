# Batch files for doing things automatically. 

### Stuff Used

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

### Where to get batch links for VODS
I personally use [Twitch ANZ](https://www.twitchanz.com/vods) to get batch links of vods. Afterwards, you can open the downloaded file in Notepad++ and remove the url part leaving the VOD ID only.

Download VOD: Downloads the vod.
Download Chat: Downloads the chat.
Render Chat: Renders chat into mp4 format and is transparent.
Download Chat and Render: Downloads the chat and renders it into mp4 format and is transparent.
