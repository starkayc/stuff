# Batch files for doing things automatically. 
### Purpose of each batch file
* AIO For Twitch: Downloads vod and chat, then renders chat into a mp4 and then gets burned into the vod file.
* Download VOD: Downloads the vod.
* Download Chat: Downloads the chat.

### Where to get batch links for VODS
I personally use [Twitch ANZ](https://www.twitchanz.com/vods) to get batch links of vods. Afterwards, you can open the downloaded file in Notepad++ and remove the url part leaving the VOD ID only.
